### Dictionary

#### 6.00 Points

Create a constructor function named `Dictionary` that returns an instance (object) that represents a dictionary. The Dictionary instance can store words as keys and properties as values, the words and definitions are attached directly on the instance.

In addition, the following methods should be accessible via the prototype chain:

- `newEntry` - adds a new word and definition to the instance
- `getDefinition` - returns the definition that corresponds to the word argument
- `getWordsWithFirstLetter` - it accepts a letter and as an argument and returns an object with all the words that start with the letter argument
