### Right Angle Triangles

#### 8.00 Points

A right angle triangle is any triangle with a right angle.

For example:

*
**
***
****
*****
******

This is a right angle triangle since the right angle (90 degree angle) is located at the bottom left of the triangle. Since the right angle is located at the bottom left, we'll call this triangle a ** right angle bottom left **.

Here is another example:

     *
    **
   ***
  ****
 *****
******

This is another right angle triangle since the right angle (90 degree angle) is located at the bottom right side of the triangle. Since the right angle is located at the bottom right of the triangle, we'll call this triangle a ** right angle bottom right **.

Here are two more examples:

**Right Angle Top Left**

**Right Angle Top Right**

#### Directions

Create the following functions that create right angle triangles:

- `rightAngleBottomLeft`
- `rightAngleBottomRight`
- `rightAngleTopLeft`
- `rightAngleTopRight`

Every function will have a similar pattern, your job is to figure out the small difference in logic to create a specific type of right angle triangle.

Note: Pay attention to detail when reading the test stpecs and reading the output of your functions. If there is an extra new line or an extra space, etc, you will fail the spec. Attention to detail is very important!
